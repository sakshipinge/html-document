<hr width="80%"></hr>
<p>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads.<br> Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently.<br> Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.<br>The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe.<br> These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.<br> </p>
